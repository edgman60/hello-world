Initial Repository for learning what this is all about

Adding some comments about myself per the tutorial.  

I've been coding C for many years.  I weathered the storm of 
COM and C-with-Classes to be able to say that I have programmed C++,
but now I am finding that C++(11)(14)(17) is a totally different animal.
I'm using this resource to learn and build C++ tools for my own use and 
to share them with others if they find them useful.
